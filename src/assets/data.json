    "description": "Hello! I am a programmer located in Toronto, Canada. I have a couple years of professional experience working in corporate/enterprise environment. I very much so enjoy programming and working with people/teams. I am a very technical person and love talking about implementation details. I also like to follow technology as it evolves. I'm particularly interested in compilers & programming languages although business solutions love to implement CRUD(S) systems which do pay the bills. Oh and I tend not to take life too seriously!",
