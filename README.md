# Portfolio

This will be my personal portfolio. I hate doing UI work so I'm gonna be using as many material components as I can. However, the goal is a polished website down the to granularity. So screen size responsiveness is on the radar and i'll try to make it look nice.

There is a possibility I will just abandon is project as well. So we will see. Working on this mobile first
